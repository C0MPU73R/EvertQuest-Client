I.  System Requirements

Windows® 95 or Windows 98
Pentium 166(or greater)
32 MB RAM
Direct3D or Glide compliant card w/ 4MB RAM
28.8k bps connection
Windows compatible sound card

II.  Technical Issues
If you are running EverQuest for the first time, or are encountering sound and video related problems, please make sure that you are using the most current drivers available on the hardware manufacturer's web-site. 

Make sure that DirectX 5.2 or newer is installed on the system when running EverQuest.  DirectX 5.2 is included on the EverQuest Phase 3 beta CD.

Problem:  When attempting to login to the World Server or while playing, the game crashes to Windows.
Solution:  Make sure that you have at least 300 megabytes of free space on the drive that the EverQuest directory is located on.

III.  Sound and Video

Problem:  When running EverQuest with a Voodoo 1 based chipset in Glide mode, item icons, on-screen overlays, and the chat has a pink boarder.
Solution:  This is a Glide driver problem, which will be resolved with an updated Glide patch from 3dfx.

Problem:  When running EverQuest with an ATI Rage 2, Rage 2+, or Rage Pro based chipset, pink boarders will appear around the item icons, on-screen overlays, and chat.
Solution:  This is a known bug and will be fixed.

Problem: While attempting to run EverQuest with a Voodoo based chipset, the game crashes at the "EverQuest" loading screen and an error window with the message, "VXD error, expecting 1.4, found 1.X".
Solution:  You are not running the most recent drivers for your video card.  Please perform the following procedure;  Click on the "Start" button located on your Windows taskbar.  Next, highlight "Find", then select "Files or Folders…".  Then type "Glide.*" in the "Named" field and click the "Find Now" button.  After the search for the "Glide.*" file is complete, delete all of the "Glide.*" files from the list.  Once the Glide files have been deleted, you will then need to install the most recent drivers from the card manufacturer's web-site. 

Problem:  When using a card with a Banshee based chipset, you are unable to run EverQuest in Glide.
Solution:  Currently, EverQuest requires Glide 3.0 or newer in order to run in Glide mode.  However, due to the fact that the Banshee chipset was just released, 3dfx has not released a driver that allows Banshee based cards to run Glide 3.0.

IV.  Control and Interface

Problem:  When running EverQuest with a video card utilizing the TNT chipset, the character seems to "overturn" or continue to turn in a given direction while moving.
Solution:  This is a driver problem that will be addressed by Riva.

V.  Connectivity

Problem:  When attempting to run "EverQuest.exe", the following error occurs; "ERROR Host not found, no DNS entry for host"
Solution:  Make sure that you are properly connected through your ISP(Internet Service Provider).  If you have verified that you are "on-line", and you are still receiving the error, contact your ISP.
