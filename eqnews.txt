We have added the EverQuest tutorial, which is recommended for new players getting started in the world of Norrath.  To patch the tutorial, you will need to patch using the "testeverquest.exe" to receive all of the required files, then run "tutorial.exe".  Please give us any feedback that you may have for improvments that should be made.  All of the character restorations from phases 3 and 3.5 to the "Test" server should be completed by the end of the day.  Also, please note that the "News" window will only contain information regarding the current additions and bug fixes, all past news can be read from the "revision.txt" file located in your EverQuest directory.


Bug Fixes

 - The "Backstab" and "Bind Wound" skills should be working as intended.
 - We believe we have solved one of the problems that occurs when people
   would get booted at the EverQuest loading screen (with the Elf woman on it).
 - We should very shortly have fixed all of the registration problems. Try back
   later tonight if you haven't successfully registered.
 - Zones should be MUCH, MUCH more stable now. We fixed a major crash problem with them.
 - New Banshee drivers should be up on www.everquest.com - These are EverQuest specific.
   Thanks to 3dfx for giving us these drivers before they are generally released.
 - If you have a Voodoo2 and you have THE latest drivers from 3dfx, you will have
   a problem switching resolutions. Please use the drivers off of www.everquest.com, as they
   work properly.
